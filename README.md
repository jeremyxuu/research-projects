### Introduction
During my undergraduate studies in Nutrition Sciences, I had a strong passion to discover the beauty of the human ecology framework. I believe that an interdisciplinary approach can help us better identify and solve the social challenges in today's world. Thus, I'm pursuing a Master of Public Policy degree, with rigorous training in data analytics and policy analysis, pushing me to apply these skills beyond theoretical groundings.

My previous learning and community research experiences have shaped my core values in health, humanity, and sustainability, which motivated me to step into the field of healthcare. With rigorous training in methodologies and practice, I am confident and passionate about using qualitative and quantitative methods to address real life challenges at the intersection of healthcare, data science and technology.
